 * Build a DiskPoolPager project, that manages a bitmap of the size of a page, while leaving some bytes for log_seq_nr, and that can allocate and free pages, and extend the api of the bufferpool through it.

  * ARIES support
   * you can use was_flushed_to_disk to remove page from the dirty page table, and any subsequent write to the page with write lock held, to reinsert it into the dirty page table.
