* using open addressing hashmap, for reducing the memory foot print of higly fragmented red black hashmap being used for page_entry_mapper
* using a conditional timed wait to shutdown bufferpool faster
* implementeing prefetch
* prefetch can be requested with a queue, and the page_id is pushed to all the queues once the page_request is fullfilled, hence threads can process threads out of order
