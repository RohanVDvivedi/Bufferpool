* try to make more sequential io, larger and fewer read/write calls to disk/os
* selectively made dirty pages become clean and get inserted in clean pages lru queue
* build sloppy and use sloppy for page_request and page_entry structures
* build page directory manager, to manage a map of compressed on disk pages
* reduce memory foot print 
	* by inserting the page entry to page table, inside the io_dispatcher itself
	* by discarding the page request at the earliest after the page entry reaches the page table
	* use enum based bit fields for represent all flags in just 8 bits
	* dbfile is an attribute of the buffer pool, remove the duplicate form the page entry, and use dbfile as a parameter only in the page entry to read or write
