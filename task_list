* try to make more sequential io, larger and fewer read/write calls to disk/os
* using open addressing hashmap, for reducing the memory foot print of higly fragmented red black hashmap being used for page_entry_mapper
* implementeing prefetch
* prefetch can be requested with a queue, and the page_id is pushed to all the queues once the page_request is fullfilled, hence threads can process threads out of order
