 * upon decrementing max_frame_description_count
  * you can also discard clean frames along with the invalid ones

 * (*future) mechanism to prioritize pages that will be evicted
   * proposed system
     * function pointer to get priority of a page from the page data and page_id
     * only clean pages are maintained as a heap with least priority at the top
     * dirty pages will still not be preferred for eviction before clean andin valid pages, it will be left as a linked list behaving as LRU, hence cleaning up least recently used pages first
     * there will also be an age factor higher the age of the clean page, higher the age since it was last used, lower will be its priority
