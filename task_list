 * convert all rwlock based *_lock(BLOCKING) calls to fixed amount of timeout_in_microseconds (preferrable 1 second or a user supplied value) calls, to avoid blocking a user thread indefinitely
   * these calls must be checked that if they fail, we return 0 or NULL

 * mechanism to prioritize pages that will be evicted
   * inserting to clean pages lru also inserts into a skew or leftist pheap
   * only if a priority function to get priority from page_id and page_pointer is specified
   * make mechanism to avoid possibility to a page always sticking into the cache by implementing some form of decay
   * remove and inserts to clean_frame_descs_lru_list, also triggers the same from this pheap
   * ponder on how to avoid LFU kind of issues where a high priority page just never gets evicted
