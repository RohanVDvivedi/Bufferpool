 * selectively made dirty pages become clean and get inserted in clean pages lru queue

 * build sloppy and use sloppy for page_request and page_entry structures (*future feature, when Sloppy is tested enough, we can not take that risk at this satge, also page_entries are allocated only one time, hence this is not needed)

 * build page directory manager, to manage a map of compressed on disk pages (*future feature)
