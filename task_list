 * allow to force_reset_was_modified flag while releasing read or write lock on a page OR while downgrading from a writer lock
   * add comment that this flag is to be used for a free page, when you do not want to persist it to disk, because the page has been freed
   * this will allow not writing a free page onto disk, saving write io
   * such a page will directly be put in clean_frame_descs_lru_list, and will get evicted in future, without its contents going onto the disk
   * this flag if true, doesn't care about the values of was_modified and force_flush parameters
 * run can_be_flushed_to_disk and logic to set/reset the was_modified bit if the lock operation on the page is successfull, i.e. after downgrade lock
