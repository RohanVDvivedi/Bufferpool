 * convert all rwlock based *_lock(BLOCKING) calls to fixed amount of timeout_in_microseconds (preferrable 1 second or a user supplied value) calls, to avoid blocking a user thread indefinitely
   * these calls must be checked that if they fail, we return 0 or NULL

 * (*future) mechanism to prioritize pages that will be evicted
   * proposed system
     * function pointer to get priority of a page from the page data and page_id
     * only clean pages are maintained as a heap with least priority at the top
     * dirty pages will still not be preferred for eviction before clean and invalid pages, it will be left as a linkedlist behaving as as LRU, hence cleaning up least recently used pages first
     * there will also be an age factor higher the age of the clean page, higher the age since it was last used, lower will be its priority
